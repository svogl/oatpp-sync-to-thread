# oatpp-sync-to-thread

This is a minimal example for [Oat++](https://oatpp.io/) that syncs a request controller to a background thread.

This example is meant to be self-contained and use only a minimal set of features to highlight the synchronisation of frontend-calls vs. backend activity in another thread.
